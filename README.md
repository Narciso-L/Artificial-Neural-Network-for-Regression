# Artificial-Neural-Network-for-Regression

### Build an ANN Regression model to predict the electrical energy output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant

The objective is to create a data model that predicts the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant using available hourly average ambient variables.

Go hands-on with Hadelin in solving this complex, real-world Deep Learning challenge that covers everything from data preprocessing to building and training an ANN, while utilizing the Machine Learning library, Tensorflow 2.0, and Google Colab, the free, browser-based notebook environment that runs completely in the cloud. It’s a game-changing interface that will supercharge your Machine Learning toolkit.

Check out what’s in store for you when you enroll:

**Part 1: Data Preprocessing**
- Importing the dataset
- Splitting the dataset into the training set and test set

**Part 2: Building an ANN**
- Initializing the ANN
- Adding the input layer and the first hidden layer
- Adding the output layer
- Compiling the ANN

**Part 3: Training the ANN**
- Training the ANN model on the training set
- Predicting the results of the test set
